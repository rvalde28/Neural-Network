# Neural-Network

Neural Network for letter recognition

Uses back propagation for training. Training consists of 5x7 matrices that represents a letter:

1111110
0001001
0001001
0001001
1111110

This is the letter A. The user inputs the string:
11111100001001000100100010011111110

and the neural network will detect this as a letter A. Neural net has 99% accuracy.
